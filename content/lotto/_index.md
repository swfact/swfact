The 59ers Club is a private lottery run by the South Woodham Ferrers Independents to raise funds and engage with our supporters. As a private lottery membership of the club is by invitation only, you will then be allocated a number for the draws.

Before Oct 2015 the Lotto featured 49 numbers and this was labelled the "49ers Goldrush"

To ensure a fair and random draw we will be using the Bonus Ball that is drawn by the National Lottery on the first Saturday of each month to find a winner.

Tickets will therefore be numbered 1-59 - and your ticket will be valid for one year, entering you in 12 draws.

For just £1 per month you can support your local independent candidates, and each month you could win £30.

South Woodham Ferrers Independents will continue to speak out for the town. We will represent South Woodham Ferrers in local elections, and not follow a national party line that may neglect the needs of our community.
