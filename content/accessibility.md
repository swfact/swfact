We want everyone who visits the South Woodham Ferrers Association of Council Tax payers website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.
What are we doing?

To help us make the South Woodham Ferrers Association of Council Tax payers website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.

The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We've chosen Level AA as the target for the South Woodham Ferrers Association of Council Tax payers website.
How are we doing?

We've worked hard on the South Woodham Ferrers Association of Council Tax payers website and believe we've achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch and let us know.
