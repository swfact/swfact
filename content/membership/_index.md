As we want to represent the town instead of Westminster we think engagement with the community is extremely important. If you want to be part of our efforts to work for the town we’d love to hear from you – we are always interested in hearing from people who wish to become members. Membership doesn’t have to be hard work, we undertake many things throughout the year and our members help out when and where they can.

If you wish to find out more about joining please contact us at <a href="mailto:membership@swfact.org">membership@swfact.org</a> or through the form below.
