Every vote counts. Every voice should be heard. That’s what democracy is all about.

[Registering to vote](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/how-to-register-to-vote) ensures you get a say in government. Do you really want to stay quiet?

To make things even better, voting has never been easier! The polling stations are open for a long time so many people can vote in person, but if for whatever reason you can’t you also have the options of a [proxy vote](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/apply-to-vote-by-proxy), or the ever more popular [postal vote](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/postal-vote-application) – both great options to help make you get the representation you want.

However you vote it informs and moulds future decisions. Register to be heard!
